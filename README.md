#**Hello fellow Git-Hubbers,**

    My name is **Jim (gorgonzolaChs)**, and me and my pal **Eric (orcus50)** decided to play around with sockets to create what we think is an awesome game.





##**Instructions**
> Once in the game you created or joined launches you have a variety of commands to choose from : 
>> '1' - Mousing over a square that you own and pressing the '1' key will spawn a wall at the cost of 100 units.  This wall increases that tiles defensive bonus for your army.
>> '2' - Mousing over a square that you own and pressing the '2' key will spawn a producer at the cost of 200 units.  
        Producers can be found naturally spawned around the map as well and will produce a unit every other second.
>> 'click and drag' - Clicking on a tile containing more that one of your own units and dragging your cursor to a desired destination and releasing will cause your selected army to start marching.  
        Armies will leave 1 man behind every empty tile as to retain control.  Armies are also too weak to scale the rough terain of mountain tiles, so you should probably just have them walk around...
>> 'hold space then click and drag' - Holding down the spacebar and then performing a move to an adjacent tile to and army will split that stack between the two tiles.  
        Armies can be split to any tile except for mountains because again, they forgot to carb load and are feeling a little weary.  Maybe a little combat will liven them up.
>> 'Escape' - All of the commands you send will take time to take effect.  You are leading this whole campaign by yourself afterall.  Give it some time and eventually your troops should listen.  
        If you don't feel like waiting around you can always press 'esc' to cancel all previous not performed commands to start fresh and allow for quick decisions to pile up once more.
